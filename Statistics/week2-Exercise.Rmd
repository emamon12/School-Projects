```

*Directions*: 

* Write your R code inside the code chunks after each question.
* Write your answer comments after the `#` sign.
* To generate the word document output, click the button `Knit` and wait for the word document to appear.
* RStudio will prompt you (only once) to install the `knitr` package.
* Submit your completed laboratory exercise using Blackboard's Turnitin feature. Your Turnitin upload link is found on your Blackboard Course shell under the Laboratory folder.

1. You will work with a matrix whose entries are all prime numbers below 30.  
      i)  Create this matrix using the function `matrix()` with five rows. Save the matrix as `P`.  
      ii) Extract the second and third row out of `P`.  
      iii) Extract the entry in the fourth row and first column of `P`.  
      iv) Generate the transpose of the matrix using the function `t()`. What is the new dimension of this matrix.  

### Code chunk
```{r}
# Insert your code for this question after this line

n <- 30

x = seq(2, n)
prime_nums = c()

for (i in seq(2, n)) {
	if (any(x == i)) {
		prime_nums = c(prime_nums, i)
		x = c(x[(x %% i) != 0], i)
	}		
}

P <- matrix(c(x), nrow = 5, ncol = (length(x)/5))
c(P[2,],P[3,])
P[4][1]
t(P) #the transpose of P is 2x5



```

2. Create and manipulate a data frame.
      i) Create a `data.frame` named `my.trees` that has the following columns:  
          - `Girth = c(8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 10.5, 10.7, 10.8, 11.0)`  
          - `Height = c(70, 65, 63, 72, 81, 83, 66)`  
          - `Volume = c(10.3, 10.3, 10.2, 16.4, 18.8, 19.7, 15.6)`  
      ii) Extract the fifth observational unit.  
      iii) Extract the `Girth` column referring to it by name.  
      iv) Print out a data frame of all the observations except for the last observation.  


### Code chunk
```{r}
# Insert your code for this question after this line

my.trees <- data.frame(Girth = c(8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 10.5, 10.7, 10.8, 11.0), Height = c(70, 65, 63, 72, 81, 83, 66), Volume = c(10.3, 10.3, 10.2, 16.4, 18.8, 19.7, 15.6))
my.trees[5,]
my.trees$Girth
head(my.trees, length(my.trees)-1)

# last R code line
```

3. The popular `iris` data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The `iris` data set is included with every R installation.  
      i) Check the structure of the`iris` data.   
      ii) How many variables and observations are in the data set?   
      iii) Which variables are `numeric` type?  
      iv) Display the first 4 rows of the data.  


			
### Code chunk
```{r} 
# Insert your code for this question after this line

str(iris)	#there are 150 objects and 5 variables
			#sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width are all numberic
			
n <- 4
head(iris, n)

# last R code line
```



  
4.  You will work with the passenger Titanic data found on this [link](<https://goo.gl/NHb1Pg>).   
      i) Read this data directly from the web using its URL.  
      ii) Read this data by saving it first into your working directory. Check your working directory using `getwd()` or change its location using the steps covered in the lesson.  
      iii) How many passengers and what variables are in the data set?   
      iv) Display the first 5 rows of the data.  

### Code chunk
```{r}
# Insert your code for this question after this line

titanic <- read.csv("https://goo.gl/NHb1Pg", head = TRUE)
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Documents/R/inputs")
titanic <- titanic.csv #there are 1316 passangers denoted by how many objects there are. There are 5 variables

n <- 5
head(titanic, n)

```
