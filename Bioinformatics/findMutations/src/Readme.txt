Developed on Visual Studio Code 1.37.1
Java version 8 update 211 (build 1.8.0_211-b12)

For Windows: To compile, type make in the findMutations directory. To run, type run in the findMutations directory.

For Linux/Mac: To compile, type make in the app directory. To run, type java app.App in the findMutations directory.

Put input files inside the input folder within the findMutations directory.

Since sequence alignment is not being accounted for, any sequences that are different length will be immediately flagged.

Similarly, if too many mutations are found, both sequences are immediately flagged.

Code lacks documentation(just not enough time). For code issues please email me at emamon@siue.edu.
