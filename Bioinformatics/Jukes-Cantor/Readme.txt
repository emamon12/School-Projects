Developed on Visual Studio Code 1.37.1
Java version 8 update 211 (build 1.8.0_211-b12)

For Windows: To compile, type "make" in the Jukes-Cantor directory. To run, type "run" in the directory. To delete class files, type "clean".

For Linux/Mac: To compile, type "make" in the Jukes-Cantor directory. To run, type "make run" in the directory. To delete class files, type "make clean".

Put input files inside the input folder within the SequenceAlignment directory(only the alignment.fasta is needed for this).

For inputs, all white spaces are removed and each sequences is separated by the '>' character.

The output for the K values in the format of K(a,b) is printed in the output folder.

All of the outputs are titled dynamically, based on the name given by the '>' identifier.

I included the PDF file since the PNG file looks really bad.
