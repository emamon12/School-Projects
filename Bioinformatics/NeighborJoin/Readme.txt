Developed on Visual Studio Code 1.40.1
Java version 8 update 231 (build 1.8.0_231-b11)

For Windows: To compile, type "make" in the NeighborJoin directory. To run, type "run" in the directory. To delete class files, type "clean".

For Linux/Mac: To compile, type "make" in the NeighborJoin directory. To run, type "make run" in the directory. To delete class files, type "make clean".

Put input files inside the input folder within the NeighborJoin directory(The files need to be .txt files and should be formatted similarly as the example given).

All outputs are shown in the console. Both the distance matrix, r-values, and transition matrix are given.

Some code has been re-used from my own previous projects, mainly the UPGMA project, thus the output is formatted similarly.
